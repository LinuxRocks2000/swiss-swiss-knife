Crazy, right? Yes, you can use plain HTML with code inlined via on-x event attributes and the script tag, but definitely not recommended for larger projects

Regardless, I've attempted my best to make each as standalone as possible, meaning, you can pack one of these home with you and plop it about any where and it should work on it's own
